> "Any improvement made anywhere besides the bottleneck is an illusion." — Eliyahu Goldratt

In the world of business improvement, we often confuse "being busy" with "being productive." Teams rush to optimize every part of a process simultaneously, believing that if everyone works faster, the whole system will move faster.

They are wrong.

This is the core lesson of the **Theory of Constraints**: every system has *one* constraint (a bottleneck) that limits its total output. If you optimize anything else, you are just piling up inventory in front of the bottleneck or waiting for work that isn't coming.

## Identifying the Bottleneck

How do you find the bottleneck? It’s usually where the pile-up is.

1.  **Look for the Queue:** Where is the "inbox" overflowing? Is it the QA team? Is it the final executive approval? Is it the data entry step?
2.  **Look for the Stress:** Where are people constantly working overtime?
3.  **Look for the Expediters:** Where are managers constantly stepping in to "push things through"?

## The 5 Focusing Steps

Once you found it, don't just "try harder." Use Goldratt's 5 steps:

1.  **Identify the Constraint:** (e.g., The Legal Review team can only review 5 contracts a day).
2.  **Exploit the Constraint:** Ensure the constraint is never idle. Do they have everything they need before they start? Are they doing administrative work that could be done by someone else? Every minute the bottleneck is idle is a minute lost for the *entire company*.
3.  **Subordinate Everything Else:** This is the hard part. Other teams might have to *slow down* to match the pace of the bottleneck. Producing more contracts than Legal can review just creates a confusing backlog.
4.  **Elevate the Constraint:** If step 2 didn’t solve it, *now* you spend money. Hire more lawyers. Buy better software.
5.  **Repeat:** Once the bottleneck is broken, a new one will emerge elsewhere. The process of improvement never ends.

## The BA's Role

As a Business Analyst, your job isn't just to document the process as it exists. Your job is to find the constraint and design a future state that breaks it.

Stop optimizing the parts. Start optimizing the flow.
